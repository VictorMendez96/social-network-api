## Description
#### User Story 

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


#### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list


## Installation

This application is demonstrating the back-end function of a social network site. Start the installation process by downloading the application locally and running the command below in a terminal while in the application folder:
```
npm i
```

This will install all dependencies. You will also need an API client to run CRUD API calls, like Insomnia.


## Usage

Once all dependencies are installed and you have booted up your API client, you will begin the program by running the following command in a terminal in the program folder: 
```
npm run start
``` 

You will open your API Client and start making CRUD requests to the API.
